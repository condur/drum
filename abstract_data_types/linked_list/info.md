# A linked list is a data structure used for storing collections of data. 

__A linked list has the following properties:__
• Successive elements are connected by pointers
• The last element points to NULL
• Can grow or shrink in size during execution of a program
• Can be made just as long as required (until systems memory exhausts)
• Docs not waste memory space (but takes some extra memory for pointers)

## The following operations make linked lists an ADT: 

__Main Linked Lists Operations:__
• Insert: inserts an clement into the list
• Delete: removes and returns the specified position clemen t from the list

__Auxiliary Linked Lists Operations:__
• Delete List: removes all clements of the list (dispose of the list)
• Count: returns the number of elements in the list
• Find n-_th_ node from the end of the list
